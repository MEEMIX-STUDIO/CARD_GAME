🛠️ Build & Development

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game logic is controlled by the script.js file, which handles card shuffling and click events 📌

.

Core matching logic includes:

  - Shuffling card positions when the game loads

  - Checking whether the selected cards match

  - Tracking progress or displaying the game completion state

The concept is similar to classic “Memory Match” or “Pairs” games, where all cards start face down and players flip two cards at a time until all matches are found.

.

🎚️ Difficulty levels (e.g. 4×4 → 6×6)
⏱️ Timer / scoring system
🏆 Player ranking or leaderboard
🎵 Sound effects and animations
